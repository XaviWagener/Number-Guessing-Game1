# Number-Guessing-Game1
To play this game you need to type in a number between 1 and 100.
You have a total 10 attempts to guess a secret random number generated every time it's ran.
If you guess correctly you win showing a congradulations sentence and the number of attempts it took for you to guess the number! If not then you lose!
If the number you guess is lower then the secretive number it will print too low!
Whereas if the number is higher then the secretive number it will print too High!
Don't worry about invalid number as they do not even count towards an attempt and will ask again to guess a number.
